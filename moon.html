<!-- AI used for descriptions was ChatGPT 5.2.
Prompt: I'm creating a two page website displaying earth and the moon. I'm titling it Journey Through Space. The first page focuses on Earth, and the second on the moon. I need a description for each of these planets on the respective page. Something on the simpler side so that kids can understand it, but still witty! I don't want it very dumbed down, think maybe middle-school kid range and above. -->

    <h3>Earth's Cosmic Companion</h3>

    <p> The Moon is Earth’s closest neighbor in space and its constant companion. It doesn’t have air to breathe or weather to watch, but its rocky surface is packed with craters from ancient space impacts. The Moon lights up our night sky by reflecting sunlight and plays a big role in creating ocean tides on Earth. As it circles our planet, the Moon changes shape—from full and glowing to a thin crescent—reminding us that space is always in motion.</p>
