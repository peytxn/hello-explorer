<!-- AI used for descriptions was ChatGPT 5.2.
Prompt: I'm creating a two page website displaying earth and the moon. I'm titling it Journey Through Space. The first page focuses on Earth, and the second on the moon. I need a description for each of these planets on the respective page. Something on the simpler side so that kids can understand it, but still witty! I don't want it very dumbed down, think maybe middle-school kid range and above. -->

    <h3>Our Home Planet</h3>

    <p> Earth is the only planet we know of that’s bursting with life. From deep blue oceans and towering mountains to forests, deserts, and cities, Earth is always changing and full of surprises. It has just the right mix of air, water, and warmth to support plants, animals, and people. As Earth spins and orbits the Sun, it gives us day and night, seasons, and a place to call home—floating through space like a perfectly balanced spaceship.</p>
